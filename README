OVERVIEW

L1 is a language with JavaScript syntax and visualization semantics. It compiles
JavaScript code to a collection of graphics files (PNG and SVG) that render the
static semantics of the input.

   cd build
   ./make.sh

This produces the file:

   ../bin/l1c.swf

    some.source.js.karyotype

(and possibly supplementary files.)
